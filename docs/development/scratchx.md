# ScratchX & TurboWarp

TurboWarp now has primitive support for using ScratchX extensions and loading ScratchX projects (.sbx). ScratchX was a modified version of Scratch 2 created by the Scratch Team that allowed using unofficial extensions. ScratchX no longer functions due to Flash being removed from all major browsers, and the website was finally shut down in early 2023.

To use a ScratchX extension in TurboWarp, find the URL to the extension's JavaScript source code and load it as you would any other [custom extension](/development/custom-extensions).

ScratchX extensions run in the extension sandbox, and anything related to hardware will not work.
