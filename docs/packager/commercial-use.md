# Can I sell projects made with the TurboWarp Packager?

Yes, if you have the rights to all the costumes, sounds, scripts, and extensions inside the project you package, it is possible to sell it.

The open source components of Scratch and TurboWarp used by the packager are available under open source licenses that allow you to use, modify, distribute, and sell packaged projects without fees or royalties. It is also important to note that these licenses do not offer a warranty. Some parts of TurboWarp use "weak" copyleft licenses such as the [Mozilla Public License version 2.0](https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/). Grossly simplified, this means that if you modify the those parts of the code, you must share just that specific code under the same license.

If you used costumes, sounds, scripts, or extensions created by other people, make sure you have permission from those people to sell their work. Most things you find on the Scratch website are supposed to be available under the [CC BY-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/) license which technically doesn't prevent you from re-selling the work, but it requires attribution and the share-alike clause may have significant implications. Creators can grant you additional permissions on top of the CC BY-SA 2.0 if they choose.

Note that the Scratch trademarks such as the Scratch Logo, Scratch cat, Gobo, Pico, etc. are an exception to the CC BY-SA 2.0 license, and you might not have permission to use them.

For more information, see "May I use / remix Scratch support materials, sprites, images, sounds or sample projects I’ve found on the website?" and "Can I sell my Scratch projects?" in https://scratch.mit.edu/faq
